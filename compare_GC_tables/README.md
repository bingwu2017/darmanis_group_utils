# GCcompare

## Using GCcompare
GCcompare is written in R. It was adapted from a previous version written by Steven Chen, the use of which is to compare gene count tables of the same biological sample from different preparation methods (example: one single cell plate, with multiple library preparations using differing enzyme concentrations).
