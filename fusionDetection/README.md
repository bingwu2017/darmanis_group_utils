## Fusion Detection Working Directory

`Date: May 2018`

Collection of scripts for detecting fusion transcripts from scRNA-seq 
data.     

**_TODO:_** Workflow. How do you actually run this thing? What directory
structure is required? Can I set this up to run from within a Snakemake
file?                          
**_TODO:_** Testing. Not sure if all of these scripts are functional.
