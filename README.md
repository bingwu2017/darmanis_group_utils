`CZ Biohub, May 2018`

This is an active repo for code used for scRNA-seq analysis within the Darmanis
group at the Biohub. The goal is to set up separate folders for each project and
provide high quality documentation for each project and script. It would be good
to provide examples of the directory structure required to run each script as well.
Code should be generalizable in the sense that its not entirely specific to your 
project/system/machine, so that it can be pulled down and run by other members of 
the group. Feel free to submit Issues with suggestions for scripts to push up, 
other project folders to start, etc. 

Remember to **_PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH!_**     

Also, be sure to add `README.md`s to whatever directories you initialize
