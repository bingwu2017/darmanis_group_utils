**TODO:** How to organize this repo? Do we want a single repo for all of 
	  the utility scripts our group might use? Or separate repos for 
	  each topic?          
**TODO:** Better documentation of code, including description of the 
	  directory structure requried to run each script. Code should be 
	  generalizable rather than specific to the tasks I've used them
	  for.              
**TODO:** What other scripts should we push up?
