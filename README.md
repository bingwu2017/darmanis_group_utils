**_TODO:_** How to organize this repo? Do we want a single repo for all of 
	  the utility scripts our group might use? Or separate repos for 
	  each topic?          
**_TODO:_** Better documentation of code, including description of the 
	  directory structure requried to run each script. Code should be 
	  generalizable rather than specific to the tasks I've used them
	  for.              
**_TODO:_** What other scripts should we push up?           


**_PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH!!_**     

Also, be sure to add `README.md`s to whatever directories you initialize
