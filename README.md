## Darmanis_group_utils         

`CZ Biohub, May 2018`

repo for config and intro scripts that we've made while working with various
scRNAseq tools. Note that this is NOT a project specific repo, and if you 
have code specific to a certain project, or are developing a new tool, 
it should NOT be submitted here. In fact, maybe we should get rid of this 
repo entirely...
