**TODO:** How to organize this repo? Do we want a single repo for all of 
	  the utility scripts our group might use? Or separate repos for 
	  each topic? 
**TODO:** Better documentation of code, including description of the 
	  directory structure requried to run each script. 
**TODO:** What other scripts should we push up?
