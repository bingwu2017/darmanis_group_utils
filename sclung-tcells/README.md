## SCLung -- TCells

`date: May 2018`

Scripts and source files used for _A.Maynard_ and _L.Harris_'s single-cell lung 
(specifically tCell) project. 

_5/18_ -- Got this working. `s3_transfer_ashley_cells.py` works in a time efficient
manner. Pulls from `s3_util_edit.py` library. TCell list source file is 
`ashleyTCells.csv`. You can download this repo and run this script locally -- does 
not require spinning up an instance. 

_7.24_ -- Added TRACER run and helper scripts
